#### March 23, 2020 by [Matt](/)

Several trends in technology have accelerated as both corporations and consumers adapt to a new world in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. We discuss five trends that our analysts are watching closely.

1. Subscription model is becoming the norm as cloud computing spreads


Cloud computing has become increasingly widespread in recent years. One of the byproducts of the shift to the cloud is that software has matured from a one-size-fits-all product released in cycles, into a cloud-based, customized, continuously evolving set of solutions that companies monetize through subscription-based models. That has allowed developers to design products that are a better fit for clients, build a stable subscriber base, and increase efficiency and productivity. For the software providers, this translates into a recurring revenue stream that is more stable than the lumpiness of capital expenditure cycles that happened every few years.

The fastest growing form of cloud computing is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), which refers to cloud-based resources that help establishments build and manage servers, networks, operating systems and data storage. The popularity of IaaS stems from organizations’ ability to administer their software requirements and infrastructure as they expand. Better yet, it allows companies to manage their hardware needs without hosting any of the infrastructure.

The other rapidly growing area is Software as a Service (SaaS). SaaS denotes cloud-based software that is hosted online by a software provider, is available for purchase via a subscription-based model and delivered through the internet. SaaS is the most common cloud service and is often accessible through convenient online platforms that allow employees and companies easy access to productivity-enhancing tools. The largest providers of cloud computing — Amazon’s Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft’s Azure, and Google’s Cloud Platform — are well-known. Cloud computing was not the core business of any of these three firms, but their growth in this area has been hugely accretive to their stock price and is likely to remain a growth driver.

Meanwhile, Adobe, an industry leader in digital marketing solutions through its Creative Cloud, is another interesting case study on the evolution of Software as a Service. The company was able to reduce the cyclicality of its revenues (previously tied to volatile marketing budgets) by adopting a subscription/cloud model for its creative software services such as Photoshop and Illustrator. And what Adobe is for creative, Autodesk is for architecture, construction and industrial design firms. Autodesk’s transition to a subscription model should benefit the firm in the long term, as it continues to provide software solutions for the industries it serves.`
